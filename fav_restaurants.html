   <h1>What are the best places to eat in New Orleans?</h1>
    <p>You'd probably be surprised.</p>
    <p>For a city so well known for its rich culinary traditions, a
        shocking amount of restaurants provide, at best, a lackluster
        experience for those, visiting or living here, who want to
        expand their horizons.
    </p>
    <u><h2>LAZY RESTAURANTEURS HATE THIS ONE SIMPLE TRICK:</h2></u>
    <p>The trick is easy - stop going places that don't put in the time, effort, and vision
        necessary to maintain the culture and history of New Orleans' cuisine.
    <h2>"But wait," you ask, "then where <em>should</em> I goâ€½"</h2>
    <p>We got ya, calm down. You're never gonna make it with southern food if you keep your blood pressure that high.</p>

    <h3>Click on a link? In <em>this</em> economy?</h3>
    <p>Sure, an extra click is a lot to ask, so here's the quick rundown of spots:</p>
    <div id="budsi">
        <h4><u>Budsi's Thai</u></h4>
    </div>
    Bar none the best Thai food in town. How's that New Orleans food? If you've gotta ask you clearly don't know your history with New Orleans East.
    It's fine, we can't all be aware of...basic history.
    <br><br>
    Suffice to say you won't find a better showcase of fresh produce, perfectly blended flavors, and a little NOLA spin on things this side of Dong Phuong.
    <br><br>
    <div id="seacave">
        <h4><u>Sea Cave</u></h4>
    </div>
    Sometimes the restaurant isn't all about the food, and that's this. Sea Cave, despite being apparently <a href="https://kotaku.com/arcade-previously-attacked-by-axe-wielding-man-now-cras-1848356315">deeply cursed</a>
    remains open and a great spot to relax with people who actually live here. It's an arcade bar/restaurant, and the focus is definitely on the low key patio and the gaming room. Forget your Dave & Buster's archetypes, this is the kind of spot we all wanted in our own homes back in the year of our Lord 1997 and retro to the gills.
    <br><br>
    How's the food? I mean it's food, from a bar, and about all that that entails (re: fried and simple). It's fine. The company is where it's at, though, and any nerd is missing out on a great collective of humans by not showing up at least once.
    <br><br>
    <div id="abyss">
        <h4><u>Cafe Abyssinia</u></h4>
    </div>
    Look. I don't know you. That said, it's probably a pretty safe bet to say that you haven't dug too far into traditional African cuisines, and I've gotta say, I'm disappointed in you for it.
    <br><br>
    New Orleans famous flavors are a big mix of the cultures that made it, and, while the French and Spanish elements get lauded, you don't see enough about what was brough from Africa. Obviously, the situation is a stain on human history, but the people who ended up here brought a rich tradition that the city absolutely wouldn't be the same without. It's foundational to the techniques and flavors we've got going, and Abyssinia will prove it.
    <br><br>
    <div id="wgs">
        <h4><u>We Got Soul</u></h4>
    </div>
    Ok, first off, WGS was one of the best things we had going in years as far as traditional-with-a-spin southern/New Orleanian cooking went. Regrettably, it didn't even make it to the 2020 meat grinder.
    <br><br>
    Chef Tres was an absolute madman wizard in the kitchen, and, if we're being honest here, I'm never gonna forgive y'all for letting this one get away from us. Shame on everyone. <em>SHAME.</em>
    <br><br>
    <div id="mine">
        <h4><u>My Own Kitchen</u></h4>
    </div>
    Yeah, yeah. I know. But honestly, between my partner and me? We cook, and I mean COOK-cook, not this lazy "look I made some Kraft, it's haute cuisine over here" stuff.
    <br><br>
    What? No. No, if you haven't been invited personally you aren't getting in. Why'd I bother putting it though? Because, while we're good, that's kinda a whole part of the game here: anyone who's been around and paid attention should be at least <em>passingly</em> solid in a kitchen.
    <br><br>
    What that means, my lost little lambs, is if you're one of those asking "where's the best place to get gumbo" or "where can I find a crawfish boil" the answer is to get out there and make some friends. Like I said, it isn't just the food, it's the <em>experience</em> and the <em>love</em> put into it. Y'all wanna go get some sad French Quarter thin gumbo with a roux that had five minutes spent on it that's entirely on your own head.
